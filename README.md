# MovieDB
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, youâ€™ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

# Libraries 
This app is using the following libraries 

Retrofit

themovieDB API(To use this API you need an app key which you can generate from https://www.themoviedb.org/)

Picasso


I have used recycler view to implement the grid for the app and retrofit to turn my HTTP API into a Java interface.
